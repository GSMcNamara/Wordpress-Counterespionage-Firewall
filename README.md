# Floodspark Counterespionage Firewall (CEF) plugin for WordPress

The CEF-WP plugin is free and open source. So far it can detect and block:

- Tor browser, with minor delay
- Chrome Incognito, with minor delay, over HTTPS
- Firefox Private Browsing
- Chrome-Selenium in its default configuration
- cURL in its default configuration

The [Cyber Intent Blog](http://floodspark.com/blog/) is a living demonstration of the plugin hosted intentionally on cheap, shared hosting to prove that it works in even the most resource constrained environment.

[Floodspark Counterespionage Firewall (CEF) â€“ full version](http://floodspark.com) has additional capabilities.
