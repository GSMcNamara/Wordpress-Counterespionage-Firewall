# Floodspark Counterespionage Firewall plugin for WordPress

The CEF-WP plugin is free and open source. So far it can:
- Fake out WPScan and bots by hiding your real usernames, instead supplying them with fake ones they will never be able to log in with.

...and detect and block:

- Tor browser, with minor delay
- Chrome Incognito, with minor delay, over HTTPS
- Firefox Private Browsing, with minor delay
- Chrome-Selenium in its default configuration, with minor delay
- cURL in its default configuration
- Wget in its default configuration
- HTTP methods other than GET, POST, and HEAD
- Proxy probing
