The Floodspark Counterespionage Firewall (CEF) WordPress plugin helps you block reconnaissance or otherwise illegitimate traffic including bots and scrapers. CEF for WordPress has some of the features of CEF Pro edition.

== Description ==
Floodspark Counterespionage Firewall (CEF) helps you block reconnaissance or otherwise illegitimate traffic. CEF is like a web application firewall (WAF) but protects against reconnaissance. Using Intent Indicators, CEF can detect and protect earlier than an Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) or IP blacklist-based solution. Increase performance, reduce fraud, thwart attacks, and serve your real customers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Does CEF replace a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?
No. CEF and was specifically designed to leave protection against active web attacks to WAFs, which do it best.

Does CEF replace a host firewall?
No. CEF specializes in web-type intelligence and leaves the protection of other services to the host firewall.

Should I keep my WAF and host firewall?
Yes.

Why would I buy CEF Pro then?
CEF helps you earlier in the cyber-attack chain, during the Reconnaissance stage, to disrupt malicious research efforts. Remember, attacks do not necessarily correlate with the research origin(s).

What is an Intent Indicator?
An Intent Indicator is a trait derived from cyber threat intelligence that with high confidence indicates malicious intent. You do not need to activate every Intent Indicator powering CEF if for some reason one or more break your business traffic. E.g. A bank may want to block visitors using Tor to reduce fraud, while an online newspaper may recognize that readers and journalists have an interest in using Tor to avoid censorship and retribution.

How is an Intent Indicator different than an Indicator of Compromise (IoC)?
BLUF: An Intent Indicator is earlier than an IoC. You can see why this is beneficial.

An IOC indicates that a breach already took place, allowing you only to respond after the fact. Intent Indicators are the attackerâ€™s traits, or Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), observable during the recon phase--traits, that with high confidence, would not belong to legitimate visitor traffic and behavior.
